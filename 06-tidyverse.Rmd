# Operations in the tidyverse

## Various operations

In the end, base R and the `tidyverse` package provide many efficient functions to perform most of the tasks you would want to perform recursively, thus allowing avoiding explicit for loops.

Here are some examples, and you will find much more [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/). Note the use of the pipe operator, `%>%`, that allows a clear syntax for successive operations:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# create a random tibble
library(tidyverse)
N <- 500
dt <- tibble(x     = rep(runif(N,-1,1),3), 
             y     = runif(N*3,-1,1), 
             signx = ifelse(x>0,"positive","negative"),
             signy = ifelse(y>0,"positive","negative")
)
dt
# means/sd by groups of another variable
dt %>% 
    group_by(signx) %>% 
    summarise(mean_x = mean(x), 
              sd_x   = sd(x)
             )
dt %>% 
    group_by(signx, signy) %>% 
    summarise(mean_x=mean(x), mean_y=mean(y))
# sorting
dt %>% arrange(x)
dt %>% arrange(x, desc(y))
# merge table information
dt2 <- tibble(signx=c("positive","positive","negative","negative"), 
              signy=c("positive","negative","positive","negative"), 
              value=c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))
dt2
inner_join(dt,dt2)
# add/modify a column
dt %>% mutate(w=seq_along(x), z=sin(x))
dt %>% mutate(x=seq_along(x))
# selecting columns
dt %>% select(starts_with("sign"))
dt %>% select(contains("x"))
dt %>% select(x)  # only x
dt %>% select(-x) # all but x
# filtering columns
dt %>% filter(signx=="positive")
dt %>% filter(x<0, y>.1)
# providing data to ggplot
library(ggplot2)
dt %>% filter(abs(y)> 0.1) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y, color=signy))+
        geom_point()
```



## Exercises


<details>
    <summary>**Exercise 1:** tidy data wrangling</summary>

- First, load the `tidyverse` and `lubridate` package
- Load <a href="Data/people1.csv" download target="_blank">people1.csv</a> and <a href="Data/people2.csv" download target="_blank">people2.csv</a> into `pp1` and `pp2`
- Create a new tibble `pp` by using the pipe operator (`%>%`) and successively:
    - joining the two tibbles into one using `inner_join()`
    - adding a column `age` containing the age in years (use lubridate's `time_length(x, 'years')` with x a time difference in days) by using using `mutate()`
- Display a summary of the table using `str()`
- Using `groupe_by()` and `summarize()`:
    - Show the number of males and females in the table (use the counter `n()`)
    - Show the average age per gender
    - Show the average size per gender and institution
    - Show the number of people from each country, sorted by descending population (`arrange()`)
- Using `select()`, display:
    - only the name and age columns
    - all but the name column
- Using `filter()`, show data only for
    - Chinese people
    - From institution ECL and UCBL
    - People older than 22 
    - People with a `e` in their name

pp %>% select(-name)
# Using `filter()`, show data only for

pp %>% filter(origin=='China')
# - From institution ECL and UCBL
pp %>% filter(institution %in% c('ECL', 'UCBL'))
# - People older than 22 
pp %>% filter(age>22)
# - People with a `e` in their name
pp %>% filter(grepl('e',name))
