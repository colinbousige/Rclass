# Exercise 3 (10 points)

> In high-pressure experiments, the pressure in the Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC) is calibrated through the measure of the Raman shift of a tiny ruby crystal placed in the pressure transmitting medium next to the measured sample.

> Write a function returning the pressure $P$ as a function of the ruby Raman shift position $\omega$ and the excitation laser wavelength $\lambda_l$:
$$P(\omega, \lambda_l) = \frac{A}{B}\left[\left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right)^B-1\right] (GPa)$$
where $A=1876$ and $B=10.71$, $\lambda$ is the the measured wavelength of the ruby $R_1$ line (the most energetic one) and $\lambda_0=694.24$ nm is the zero-pressure value at 298 K[^1]. The relationship between the wavenumber $\nu$ in cm$^{-1}$ and the wavelength $\lambda$ in nm is given by $\nu(\text{cm}^{-1})=\frac{10^7}{\lambda(\text{nm})}$, and the Raman shift $\omega=\Delta\nu=\nu_l-\nu=\frac{10^7}{\lambda_l}-\frac{10^7}{\lambda}$ (cm$^{-1}$).

```{r}
function(omega,lambda, A=1876, B=10.71, lambda_0=694.24){
  (A/B)*((lambda/lambda_0)^B-1)
}

```

> Write a function returning a normalized Lorentzian as a function of its center $x_0$ and its full width at half maximum $\Gamma$:
> $$L(x,x_0,\Gamma)=\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi}\frac{1}{\frac{\Gamma^2}{4}+\left(x-x_0\right)^2}$$

```{r}
Lor <- function(x, x0=0, FWHM=1){
    (FWHM/2*pi)*((1))/(((Tau^2/4)+(x-x0)^2))
}


```

> Store the list of files containing `ruby` in their name in the `Data/` folder into a variable `flist`. Print its length.

```{r}
flist<-list.files(pattern="_ruby_", path="Data")
flist
length(flist)
```

> Plot with points the first file in `flist`. Find the position of its maximum and store it in `xmax`. Guess roughly the parameters needed to fit the experimental data by `y0+A1*L(x,x1,FW1)+A2*L(x,x2,FW2)`, and add a blue line on the plot to represent this function.

```{r}

```

> Using `nls()`, fit the first spectrum in `flist` by `y0+A1*L(x,x1,FW1)+A2*L(x,x2,FW2)` and using the starting parameters you defined before. Plot the experimental data again and add the fitted spectrum as a red line.

```{r}

```

> Based on the above procedure, for each file in `flist` (so, use a `for` loop), fit the Raman spectrum by the sum of two Lorentzian functions, and store the fitting parameters into a data.frame called `ruby_fit` also containing the names of the corresponding files. Attention: the initial guesses for amplitudes and widths can be constant, but the peaks positions should evolve for each spectrum. The difference between the two peaks is always roughly 30 cm$^{-1}$, and the largest peak is always the most energetic one. Check that your fits are correct by printing the experimental data and the fitted result at each iteration (add the name of the file as the plot title).

```{r}

```

> Add a column in `ruby_fit` corresponding to the estimated pressure rounded to 1 decimal. The excitation wavelength in this experiment was 532 nm. Print the resulting `ruby_fit` table using `knitr::kable(ruby_fit)`

```{r}

```

> Store all file names containing "RBM" into a variable `fRBM`. Load all the corresponding spectra into a single `data.frame` called `spec` with 3 columns: Raman shift $\omega$, Intensity, Pressure. Of course, the indexes in the file names between the ruby and RBM files match. In the Intensity column, store the intensity normalized to [0,1].

```{r}

```

> Using `ggplot2`, plot with points the stacked normalized RBM band spectra vertically shifted by P, with a color for each spectrum corresponding to the pressure. Make the plot interactive.
